We need **Prisma Client** because it gives us a simple, safe, and efficient way to interact with our database directly from our application code.

Let’s break this down in a practical way.

---

### What does Prisma Client do?

Prisma Client is an **auto-generated JavaScript/TypeScript library** based on your data models. It lets you **query and manipulate your database** using regular JavaScript functions instead of raw SQL.

So instead of writing something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE "email" = 'alice@example.com';
```

You can write this:

```js
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: 'alice@example.com' }
});
```

### Why is Prisma Client useful?

1. **Avoids raw SQL**

   * Writing SQL by hand can be tedious and error-prone.
   * Prisma lets you use familiar JavaScript syntax to perform common database operations.

2. **Type safety**

   * Prisma generates types based on your schema, so you get autocomplete, type checking, and early error detection in your editor.

3. **Prevents mistakes**

   * If you try to query a column that doesn’t exist, Prisma will catch that during development.
   * If your database schema changes, your Prisma Client will update accordingly.

4. **Productivity**

   * You get readable, well-structured, and maintainable code for database operations.
   * Reduces boilerplate by giving you pre-built methods like `create`, `update`, `delete`, and `findMany`.

### What would happen without Prisma Client?

Without Prisma Client, you would need to:

* Write raw SQL queries by hand,
* Handle database connections manually,
* Parse results and handle type conversions yourself,
* And manage a lot of extra complexity.

Prisma Client removes all of that, so you can focus on writing your business logic instead of low-level database code.
