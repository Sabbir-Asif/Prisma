# Prisma with PostgreSQL Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Prisma in a Node.js project using PostgreSQL and TypeScript.

Before getting started:
[Learn what Prisma is](./docs/prisma.md)

---

## Installation

```bash
npm init -y
npm i --save-dev prisma typescript ts-node @types/node nodemon
npx prisma init
npx tsc --init
```

The `npx prisma init` command will create a new `prisma` directory in your project root. Inside it, you'll find a file named `schema.prisma`, which is where you define your database schema and configure the Prisma client.

---

## Step 1: Configure Your Database Connection

Open your `.env` file and set the `DATABASE_URL` with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
```

---

## Step 2: Define Your Data Model

Edit the `schema.prisma` file to define your models. For example:

```prisma
model User {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```

At this point, your model is only defined in the schema file. It hasnâ€™t been created in the actual database yet.

To apply this model to your database, run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command does two things:

1. Creates a migration file inside `prisma/migrations/` that contains the SQL to create your schema.
2. Applies the migration to your database.

## Step 3: Install Prisma Client

Install the runtime Prisma client, which your application will use to query the database:

```bash
npm i @prisma/client
```

[Learn more about Prisma Client](./docs/prisma-client.md)

---

## Step 4: Generate the Prisma Client

Generate the client based on the current schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

By default, this generates the client in the `node_modules/@prisma/client` directory.

If you want to change the output directory, you can configure it in the `generator` block of `schema.prisma`:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated/client"
}
```

This will generate the client in the `generated/client` directory instead.

This guide should help you go from setup to querying your database smoothly. For deeper topics like relational queries, aggregations, or transactions, refer to the Prisma documentation or linked articles.
